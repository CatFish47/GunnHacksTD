# GunnHacksTD

We're going to be using node.js for this project, which is essentially JS with a ton of libraries.

1. Before anything, make sure that you download, from the web, the following things:
- https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- https://git-scm.com/downloads
- https://desktop.github.com/
- https://atom.io/

The first two will be necessary to ensure that the process works. Atom is just a suitable code editor. Others will work as well. GitHub desktop makes it easier to push and pull code.

2. Clone the repo from GitHub. If you downloaded GitHub desktop, they make this super easy by just pressing on the green button that says "Clone or download" then pressing "Open in Desktop"

3. Next, go to your terminal to navigate to where the folder project is.
- cd "insert path here" (ie. Documents\Github\GunnHacksTD)

4. Initialize stuff
- Type "git init" and press enter.
- Type "npm -v" to ensure that npm is working. It should return a version number.
- Type "node -v" to ensure that node is working. It should return a version number.

5. Then, type "npm install --save". This will install all the things from --save, where I've already downloaded the node modules that we need.

6. Go on atom and open the folder as a project.

Start coding!
